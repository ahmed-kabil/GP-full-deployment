# Smart Hospital Monitoring and Management System (SHMMS)

An intelligent, full-stack web platform designed for modern healthcare environments. SHMMS provides role-based dashboards for Patients, Doctors, Nurses, Receptionists, and Admins, enabling personalized care monitoring, streamlined communication, and data-driven operational analytics.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Role-Based Access Control**: Secure, distinct dashboards for Patients, Doctors, Nurses, Receptionists, and Admins, each tailored with specific functionalities.
-   **Real-Time Patient Vitals Monitoring**: Doctors and Nurses can monitor patient vitals (Heart Rate, SpO2, Temperature) in real-time through dynamic, auto-updating charts and cards.
-   **Critical Alert System**: An automated system that triggers and displays critical alerts when a patient's vitals breach safe thresholds, ensuring immediate attention.
-   **Patient Record Management (CRUD)**: Receptionists have full capabilities to create, read, update, and delete patient records.
-   **Staff Management**: Admins can add new doctors, nurses, and receptionists to the system.
-   **Secure Doctor-Patient Messaging**: A built-in, real-time chat system allowing patients to communicate securely with their assigned doctors.
-   **AI-Powered Patient Assistant**: A helpful chatbot, powered by the Google Gemini API, assists patients with general, non-medical inquiries about hospital services.
-   **Intuitive Appointment Scheduling**: Patients can easily view available slots and book appointments with their doctor. Doctors get a consolidated view of their upcoming schedule.
-   **Responsive & Modern UI**: A clean, intuitive, and fully responsive user interface built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
-   **Light & Dark Mode**: A theme toggle allows users to switch between light and dark modes for their comfort.

## 🚀 Technology Stack

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
-   **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
-   **State Management**: React Context API
-   **Charting**: Recharts
-   **Backend Simulation**: A robust Mock API built with TypeScript to simulate all backend functionalities, including user authentication, data fetching, and real-time updates.
